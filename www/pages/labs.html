                Yay! The first project of the semester. The project guidelines were fairly minimal to promote exploration of the p5.js library. It's mainly an art piece for show! My initial plan was to plot some repeated, staggered sine waves across the screen to create some form of geometrical art. Alas, I didn't even know how to plot a sine wave in JS! Okay, who does one turn to in that case? God? Well yes, the Google Gods. "p5.js Sine Wave" took me right away to this <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/math-sine-wave.html"> Sine Wave by Daniel Shiffman </a>. Oh my, quite pretty. But as Professor Faas states, the purpose of this class is not to yoink others' code but rather to promote self-innovation and algorithmic thinking.

                <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/math-sine-wave.html"> Daniel Shiffman's p5.js Sine Wave </a> utilizes an algorithm which builds an array based on how many points need to be plotted on the screen, and then increments through it with each key being an X coordinate of a point. He then inputs that X coordinate into a sine wave function and uses that output to map the y coordinate. Ultimately, he also uses the innate loop nature of the p5.js draw() function to add a second increment directly into the draw call that actually animates the wave by slightly shifting the entire theta start value and then redrawing the entire frame.

                Tangent time! I used to be a Biology & Neuroscience major and something that I've seen over and over and over and over (you're lucky I didn't use a for loop to repeat this!) is the dual helical structure of DNA strands. Frankly it's mesmerizing and I couldn't think of anything better than a systematically evolved chain of pentose sugars and phosphates binding to another opposite chain utilizing nitrogenous bases and dipole-dipole interactions. One problem... I can't model anything that advanced.

                Okay then, let's start simple. What do I want to accomplish? The core of my program is to have a sine wave and an opposite sine wave and line segments linking them. Daniel Shiffman already built the main sine wave algorithm but to fully understand it, I reverse engineered it with variable titles that made more sense to me and added more parameters. To have the opposite wave, my first idea was to use a cosine wave which I then remembered is computationally equivalent to a phase shifted sine wave. Great! The Line segments were not difficult either, just plot a line from the wave particle of one wave to the corresponding particle of the opposite wave. I initialized arrays that ran simultaneously with the primary wave calculation and render functions. One issue, it was dull. To give it some visual oomph I added an inconsequential multiplier which I called the dilation that applied a slightly larger wave amplitude for the actual particles to build space. I also added a computation that adjusted the elliptical particles' height depending on it's rate of change compared to the previous frame. Interestingly, this had the pleasant and unintentional side effect of creating a specialization effect, as if the particles were rotating on disks rather than one dimensional vertical translations. Fantastic! Lastly I added a bit of color to the line segments with if statements depending on the size of the line segments.

                Future work on this project should optimize the code to increase FPS and allow for more dense waves as well as make more meaningful aspects of the animation such that it's less 'Proto' DNA and more like actual DNA. Anyways, I had a great time learning about some basics of p5.js in this project and I'm sure I can apply some lessons to future projects!

                    Exercise #1 primarily covers the basics of p5.js and utilizing control structures to modify visual behavior such as changing object colors or object movement. I mainly chose exercises 1, 2, and 3 in chronological order, but I'm fairly certain the code in Exercise 3 can be easily expanded to accommodate Exercise 4. As for Exercise 5, while its novel, utilizes the same basic concepts of declaring variables, initializing them in setup(), and then modifying values after using a control structure within draw().

                    A critical portion of the work is the algorithmic development. While I did not struggle with the code itself, I realized how 'stuck' I am in my ways of algorithmic development. For example, it was painstakingly boring to me to write out comments for the code describing the details rather than just quickly declaring variables, if statements, and draw calls. The issue though, is that I was writing my comments practically as code but in natural language. While I'm sure this is acceptable at this stage, it may be detrimental when the project is more complex - fixating on the code can become an issue.

                    I also came to realize two other insights: 1) Optimizing code before fully fleshing it out can make it difficult to modularize later 2) Writing code with clarity and proactively declaring variables can make it easier to modularize code and apply it elsewhere.

                    Exercise #2 primarily covers the utilization of functions on top of the p5.js basics to modularize code and increase utility and readability. There were only 3 available exercises and 3 that needed to be done so all were written. Exercise 2.1 draws a rocket at the mouse position and modularizes the rocket draw calls into a single function. Exercise 2.2 draws an inner circle with a randomly-generated color and an outer circle with the same color but the red component eliminated. Exercise 2.3 I'm not quite sure what the purpose of it is, but roughly simulates a loop of circles drawn in polar coordinate space?

                    A repeated insight I've encountered while doing the exercises is that modularization can be difficult to implement immediately. For example, with the 'Drawing Drawer' exercise that repeatedly draws a composition, the most difficult aspect for me was actually creating the 'composition' in the first place. To get a sense of scale, I went to a random pixel drawing website and began just putting shapes on the pixel grid to get a general sense of space. Frankly it was a bit difficult converting absolute positions of the shapes to relationships in two-dimensional space between shape positions. For example, 'noseconeHeight = rocketHeight - fuselageHeight - finExtraHeight' is conceptually more difficult than just plotting the point. However, it comes with the advantage of creating an easily scalable composition that sensibly scales itself to the size of the display window! I experimented with ratios and proportions until I was both satisfied with the composition and the function scaled the composition as expected with its scale argument. For future work, I'd like to be able to isolate the background animation and the rocket drawing to remove the strobing of the random star generation within the background.

                    With Red Remove, the biggest issue I encountered was the nature of JS referencing the original object instead of assigning a copy of an object. While there were many ways I tried to troubleshoot the issue of why modifications to the outer circle's color affected the inner circle, even before the modification call actually occurred, ultimately it related to the aforementioned. Nevertheless, I rudimentarily converted the p5.js color object to a string, modified the string, and then parsed the string as a color once again.

                    The final exercise for Polar Points was relatively easy as Professor Faas already outlined the algorithm and the exact steps in the exercise description. However, I'm still confused by what the aesthetic or mathematical purpose of the exercise is. I played around with it and also built a rectilinear to polar conversion function just for the sake of a computation demonstration, but ultimately it was not the most useful exercise. Though, I will employ the idea of using vectors to carry coordinates in future exercises.
